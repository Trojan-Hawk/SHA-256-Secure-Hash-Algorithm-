## What is a secure hash algorithm?
The Secure Hash Algorithm, or SHA, is a set of algorithms developed by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) and other
government and private parties. These secure encryption or "file check" functions have arisen to meet some of the top cybersecurity 
issues of the 21st century. A hash function is a type of mathematical function which turns data into a fingerprint of that data called a 
hash, the actual hashing is preformed by an algorithm which takes the input data and turns it into an output of a fixed length, which 
represents the fingerprint of the data, or message digest.

## What is SHA256?

## Project Task
- create a program that follows the standard

## Project Functions
- List all the functions
- Explain in detail what each does
- Explain your reasoning for the non-obvious
- List sources where code has been adapted from

## Issues Encountered
- Little endian machine effecting output

## Testing
- explain testing section in function
- List tested inputs, expected output and actual output

## Future Improvements
- Generate a correct example of how the algorithm should preform
- Find source issue(s) by steping through the program and outputting all variable changes in order to compare to correct example.
